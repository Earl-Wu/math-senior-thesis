In [4] and [5], Takahashi gave a simple proof of the Church--Rosser confluence theorem by using the notion of parallel reduction and Takahashi translation. Our aim of this paper is to give a simpler proof of Church--Rosser theorem using only the notion of Takahashi translation.",

This chapter discusses lambda calculus and explains how this system is able to capture all computable functions. Once a reduction strategy is chosen, the behavior of a term is determined. This gives a so-called operational semantics. The chapter presents the meaning of a λ-term, which is given by translating it to a set [M]. This set is an element of a mathematical structure in which application and abstraction are well-defined operations. In this way, a so-called denotational semantics is obtained."
